This is a repo I'm making to show my progress in Ruby from the perspective of a Javascript developer. I'm mostly follow along Zed Shaw's [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/) to guide the sandbox-y files with the below topics:

1. Variables
2. Conditionals
3. Collections
4. Loops
5. Functions
6. Native crap
7. Classes

and 2 special secrets:

8. Where are the Docs?

[here!](http://ruby-doc.org/)

9. How do I execute the code?

[do this](https://github.com/ruby/rake), and see the `skeleton_project` folder for a sample skeleton.
