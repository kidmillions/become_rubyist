This is a repo I'm making to show my progress in Ruby. I'm mostly follow along Zed Shaw's [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/) to guide the sandbox-y files with the below topics:

1. Variables
2. Conditionals
3. Collections
4. Loops
5. Functions
6. Native crap

and 2 special secrets:
6. Where are the Docs?
7. How do I execute the code?
